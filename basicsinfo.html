Conditions, which requires the energy to be totally or mainly for non- domestic use. You won’t be able to end the energy plan until the full fixed price period has ended, nor will you be able to
transferto another supplier, unless our Terms and Conditions say otherwise. Please remember, afterthe end ofthe fixed period if you have any outstanding bills we may stop you from
transferring to a new energy plan or another supplier until you have paid all the money you owe,full details of objection reasons are set out in our T&C’s. We’ll send you details of your options
and prices around 60 days before the end ofthis Fixed Price Energy Plan. If you do nothing at the end of your Fixed Price Energy Plan, you’ll move onto our Variable Price Plan. These rates are
not fixed and we may change them, or you may leave, with 30 days written or verbal notice. If you wish to leave us at the end of your Fixed Price Energy Plan – you’ll need to let us know at least
30 days before the end of your plan.
Ifthis meter is not currently supplied by us, we’ll be applying to transfer your supply to us to begin within at least the next 21 days. This may change if yourtransfertakes longerthan expected or
if you have agreed a start date that is further in the future. If you haven’t done so already, you’ll need to let your current supplier know you’ll be leaving them.
Capacity charge: Cost charged by your local Distribution Network Operator (DNO). The rate applies as a pence/kVA/day rate, where the kVA refers to the Maximum Import Capacity you’ve
agreed with your DNO.An excess capacity charge will be applied if you exceed your agreed supply capacity. This charge is applied by your DNO and is passed on to you through your bill. Please
